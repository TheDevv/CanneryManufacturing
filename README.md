## Known Issues

If a player has enough gunpowder to make one flare shell, they can make an infinite amount. This bug does not originate from the mod, but instead from the base game. In the base game, if a player has enough gunpowder for one rifle/revolver cartridge, then they are only limited by their shell casings and bullets.

Knives and hatchets are not crafted at 100% condition.
